# Drowent

This is my second website that I create to prove my skills while increasing the quality of the code produced. The website was created in React.js and all styles were created in SASS. Some items were made by myself. Such as mobile navigation which, although not a master of efficiency, was supposed to give the website uniqueness. I also used the swiper.js library to avoid generating faulty or imperfect code when the solution is ready and saves time.


Drowent is a service company specializing in the installation and service of air conditioning, ventilation as well as heat pumps and recuperation.
